# Building A Productive Team


* ### How to Build a Perfect Team:

Is about more than a group of people with the right mix of professional skills.
1. **Make a Plan**
You need a clear goals for what you want to accomplish.
2. **Rules**
A set of values, behaviors and cultural guardrails so that everybody knows how to work together.
3. **Respect**
If team members don’t feel respected, they won’t be motivated to bring their best ideas and their best selves to work.

* ### The War on Meetings:
teams need a continuously meeting structure to update each other and stay on the same page.

 each person give a quick update that answers these questions:

1. What went well ?

2. What didn’t go well ?

3. Where am I stuck?

4. What are the TOP three things to work on ?



* ### Rethinking the Work-Life Equation: 
When every member is afforded the flexibility to work at their own pace, it can lead to a happier and more productive workforce.
