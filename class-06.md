## Objects:
Are a collection that group variabls, values and function in order to create something from the real world.

*if an variable is in an object it would be called property, And functions called methods to present tasks.*
      
        the object is the curly braces of the variable:
              var lab = {};
 *this called the literal notation(the most popular).*

you can use dot notation to access to an object.
                      
                       var labName = lab(1).Name(2);
                    (1) the object (property/method)
