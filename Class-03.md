 ## lists:

 **There is three kinds of lists ordered, unordered, and defition list;**

 Ordered list is a list that numbered, and uses \<ol> tag.

 Unordered list is a list that not numdered. uses \<ul> tag.

 And each content in  lists placed between \<li>\</li> tags.

 ### Definition list: 
  **is created with \<dl> tag, and consists terms,**
  
  *usually it contains \<dt>(the defition term),*
  *and \<dd>(the defition) elements.*
 
 ## Boxes:
 To control the size of the box type box name then use *(height, width)* in css.

 **limiting box** 
 
                also in css use *min-width*
                (shows the smallest width for box in browser when it is in narrow).

                And *max-width* (for the biggest width of box when the brwser in wide window).
                The same thing for height *min-height* and *max-height*.

   **Overflow** It used when the content is larger
   than the box:

    Hidden; to hide extra text that doesn't fit from user.

    Scroll; to add scrollbar so user can see the whole text.  
    They displayed in css: over flow: (hidden or scroll).  
## Border:
    creating a border and controling it use *Css*

   **Margin** *is the space out the border.*

   **padding** *is tthe space between the border edges.*

Also can control border (width) from all  *width: 1px 1px 1px 1px;*

And can control border **style** whether wanted *dashed, solid, dotted...*

We can add a border **image** using css too.

     **Example:**
     -moz-border-image: url("images/dots.gif")
      11 11 11 11 *(stretch,repeat,or round)*;
      -webkit-border-image: url("images/dots.gif")
      11 11 11 11 stretch;
      border-image: url("images/dots.gif")
      11 11 11 11 *(stretch,repeat,or round)*;}


 ## Switch: 
   Use *switch statment* when we have many conditions 

   duing to make it easier than useing *if statment*.

   (Switch conatains *cases*.)

## Loops: 
There is three types of loop:

   **For loop:** is used when we *know how many times a loop should run.*

   **while:**  is used when we *don't know how many times it

should run.* it will stop when the value is *true*.

   **do while:** it's similar to while but it will keep 
   runing even if the value is *false*.
