## links:

**Links** to another pages are created using \<a> :

      <a href="URL">N</a> ...N: the text to click on.

*It's a good idia to organize the codes byreplacing it with folders then files of codings.*

**Relative links**:

* Same Folder  \<a href="reviews.html">Reviews</a>
* child folder  \<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>
* Grandchild Folder.. 

*As we add / to move through folders*

*You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.*

## Layout:
**block-level elements** start in new line: \<h1> \<p> \<ul> \<li>.

**inline- block elements** flow between the text: \<img> \<i>.

**Containing** is the outer box that element sets inside it.

**Absolute pposition** the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on
the page. 
 **flow** allows you to take an element in normal
flow and place *flow right,left*.
**fixed width layout** Fixed width layout
designs do not change size as the user increases
or decreases the size of their
browser window. 

## 
**Functions** lets you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. to create a function: 
*function functionName(parameters){
    statment
}* 
and to call it just type it's  name.
