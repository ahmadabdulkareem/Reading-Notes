*It's a good idia to organize the codes byreplacing it with folders then files of codings.*

**Relative links**:

* Same Folder  \<a href="reviews.html">Reviews</a>
* child folder  \<a href="music/listings.html">Listings</a>
* Grandchild Folder.. 

*As we add / to move through folders*

*You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.*

## Layout:
**block-level elements** start in new line: \<h1> \<p> \<ul> \<li>.

**inline- block elements** flow between the text: \<img> \<i>.

**Containing** is the outer box that element sets inside it.
